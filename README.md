# Colour-Game
This project is simply created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript
This is a very easy to play Colour-Game made purely with vanilla JS. The way you play it is you are given an RGB value, and depending on the mode( for Easy mode there are 3 squares and for Hard mode there are 6 squares) you choose you will be displayed a number of squares. You have to correctly guess which square it is by the RGB value.
